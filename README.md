# nba-wheel-of-fortune

### Overview

This is a command-line game that uses constructor functions. 

I feel uncomfortable calling this game "Hangman", but that's what it's typically called. 

## Instructions 

Try to clone this repo onto your local computer, run the command `npm i`, and run `node index.js` to fire the game up. 

The idea is to guess a letter for each of the top 25 NBA players of all-time. 

### Notes

This repo will be updated.
